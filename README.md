  - Make sure to "enable community" in your server if you haven't already! (`Settings` -> `Enable Community`)

## Usage ‚ú®
1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads) if you haven't already.
 
2. Install `requirements.txt` with the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
   - If you are on Windows, you might need to run command prompt as Administrator

3. Open the script by using the file `start_windows.bat/start_linux.sh` (It might be different, like Linux and MacOS can be using python3).
